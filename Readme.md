# Frost Predictor Documentation ❄️

## Project Overview 

### Introduction 
The goal of this project is to develop a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of frost occurring on car windows based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, etc.

Frost formation on car  windows can cause significant damage to both residential and commercial properties if not remediated before driving.  By using logical regression, we can create a model that not only predicts whether first will occur but also quantifies the likelihood of its formation.  This probabilistic approach could allow users to make informed decisions about whether preventive measures are needed, such as waking up a few minutes early to defrost their cars, putting on a frost guard the night before or other anti frost solutions.

This project aims to provide a simple tool to predict if frost will occur to give users time to take the appropriate measures beforehand.
